# chessless
A non-interactive terminal user interface with the Stockfish chess engine. Removes the use of user state so that Stockfish's commands can be run using a singluar command.

To access most of its commands, Stockfish is normally run interactively as a program inside the terminal. This is acceptable for a user but in some use cases where another program uses Stockfish, it is more ideal to run multiple commands in one pass. This small script addresses this problem by accepting a concatenated list of commands and printing the same stdout just without manual stdin.
