# chessless
A non-interactive terminal user interface with the Stockfish chess engine. Avoids the use of state so that Stockfish's commands can be run with singluar commands.

To access most of its commands, Stockfish is normally run interactively as a program inside the terminal. This is acceptable for a user but in some use cases where another program uses Stockfish, it is more ideal to run multiple commands in one pass. This small script addresses this problem by accepting a concatenated list of commands and printing the otherwise same stdout just without manual stdin.
